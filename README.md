# Calculator
This Python program implements a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

Features:
- Asks the user to input two numbers
- Displays available operations (+, -, *, /)
- Asks the user to choose an operation
- Performs the chosen operation and displays the result
- Asks the user if they want to continue with the result, start a new calculation, or exit
- Continues the calculation with the result if chosen
- Starts a new calculation if chosen
- Exits the program if chosen

How it works:
1. The program defines four arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and stores them in a dictionary operation_dictionary.
2. The program asks the user to input the first number.
3. It displays the available operations and asks the user to choose one.
4. It asks the user to input the second number.
5. It performs the chosen operation using the corresponding function from the operation_dictionary.
6. It displays the result of the operation.
7. It asks the user if they want to continue with the result, start a new calculation, or exit.
8. Based on the user's choice, it either continues the calculation with the result, starts a new calculation, or exits the program.
This code demonstrates basic Python concepts such as functions, dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, and input/output operations. It also uses the os module to clear the screen.
